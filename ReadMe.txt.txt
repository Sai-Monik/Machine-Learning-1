This is a basic simulation of Image classification by semisupervised Learning done in Tensorflow Python3.

Run the .py file and at first, it'll take data and constructs a Neural Network.

Each layer of the Neural Network is created by different activations.

And the Neural Netwok is trained on train data with appropriate loss functions, the error is reduced.

At last the Neural Network is tested by test data and it prints the accuracy of the Neural Network.

Self-Training method is used in the programme.
